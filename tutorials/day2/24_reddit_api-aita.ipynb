I'm just speaking from experience here. I'll leave out the details, but basically there was a family dispute about a will my grandma made 30 years ago that tore the family apart. In the end, my grandma lived for so long afterwards that by the time she passed she actually didn't have any of the assets from that old will anymore, she was basically broke and lived in assisted living.

That’s also quite concerning. And not only does she want your children with your ex to get less, she wants them to get *nothing whatsoever* because they received some stuff from their grandma?? Again, by that logic, all of your share of the money should simply cease to exist, as your kids will receive her share.

Stepdaughter will get less in the current iteration of the will because she is already an adult.

But anything accumulated while you were married should be considered marital property owned jointly with your second wife, irrespective of who’s name it’s in. This should be split 50:50 between the two of you. You can then do what you want with your 50% share. To do this under the will first make allowance for assets up to the value of any marital assets in your wife’s name to even things out. And then with balance of the marital assets in your name, give 50% to your wife. Take the left over 50%, add it to the allowance you reserved to account for your wife’s assets and split it four ways amongst your kids.

I would think she'd have a pretty good shot at successfully challenging your will.  Did you work with a lawyer for your estate planning, or did you get a kit like LegalZoom or something?

      "I agree. I've never heard of anyone cutting the surviving spouse out. I definitely know in our family, (My parents are in their late 60s and my sister and I in our 40s) that the surviving spouse is the beneficiary and then when the surviving spouse dies, whatever is left is split equally between the kids. I thought that's how everyone does it? As a sahm myself, the idea that my husband would not want me provided for in the event of his death makes me feel ill. My life insurance doesn't even come close to equaling what his does because financially, he would be way better set than I would.\n",

I would also think the family home should go only to her personally.\n",
      "That’s assuming that the owns none of the assets acquired from his salary. But he refers to “his wife’s share” of his estate. One must therefore infer that there is a separate portion of the estate that would go to his wife if he predeceases her or to their two children if she predeceases him or if they die together. The wife’s “share” may also include jointly owned assets that will automatically become the sole property of the surviving spouse if one of them dies.\n",

OP’s wife may not be in the right here regarding the equal distribution amongst his children, but she has been raising half of his kids and presumably managing their household, allowing him to work without having to pay someone else for childcare or for a cleaning service or a personal assistant, etc. It is difficult for people to enter the workplace after a large resume gap, but there are statistically proven biases against moms trying to start a career after raising kids. It’s not at all out of the question for OP’s wife to expect to have enough left to her to either cushion the difficulty in returning to the workplace or (depending on her age at the time of his death) upon which she can retire.\n",

That’s two sides of a team making sure the income comes in. If the stay at home parent stops for whatever reason, daycare is required. I don’t know if you’ve ever had to look at daycare prices, but man… the stay at home parent is 100% providing a service and benefitting the family financially. If the OP doesn’t like that setup they are absolutely welcome to pay for multiple daycare spots, but I suspect the reason he isn’t is because he knows this is far more beneficial\n",

Most SAHM stay home until the kids are IN school so, I’m not getting her argument that he’s devaluing her contributions if she at max has a couple extra hours a day with the kids when they are out of school and if they’re in after school then they’d be spending the same amount of time with the kids. She chose to be a SAHM and if he’s not paying child support then her kids technically have already received more money than his other kids so it sounds like she doesn’t want him to provide for them financially in any capacity just for the kids they have together who get a full time every day dad. What the ex wife earns and makes is irrelevant because it sounds like she’s a single mom who worked double hard to provide for her kids, take care of them solo most days.  Giving them something extra when he passes and splitting it four ways is the best way to insure that his kids know he loved them all the same when he passes. Also… if the ex wife is single and making more that the ex hubby and his new wife, why should he leave extra so the kids can take care of her? She can go back to work just like the ex wife did.

Which is totally fair, both sets of kids have their own mother and shared father. What the ex gives or doesn't give to her own kids should be no concern of the current wife. She can provide extra for her own children too. If OP tried to somehow count the financial situation of his ex and provide that amount more to his other kids his ex would basically financially support them while his current wife does nothing.

      "I'd personally value that in terms of having a better quality of life as a family, which the other 2 kids did not receive.

There would also be a clause that my stepmom can live in the house and that the split doesn't occur till the house is sold.  So no one would be kicked out.\n",

This is unless they are registered as tenants in common. Obviously we don’t know but it’s possible the home and joint account would automatically be the wife’s and it’s this “other money” that he is referring to in terms of leaving to the children. It’s hard to say because I feel like OP is not being super clear. However given that the wife seems only to be upset about the division amongst the children (rather than the prospect of being left homeless) my best guess is the house doesn’t form part of it.

I mean come on. This hits close to home for me too since my kiddos are finally school aged and we were running the numbers and it just doesn't make sense for me to get a full time job. After taxes, aftercare costs and summer camp I would only be netting an extra $10k for the family. that is less than the cost of daycare for ONE child where I am and a whole boatload of stress not to mention the severe decline in lifestyle me working outside the home would bring, PARTICULARLY to my husband who is used to coming home, relaxing and being fed leaving plenty of time to bond with his kids. we both get our weekends free from cooking, cleaning, laundry and scheduling nonsense because I do all that stuff during the week and that is a huge value to everyone. OP is an AH indeed.\n",

If he is saying that all the money in \"his name\" and investments is his and any money she has in her name is hers....then I see her point that he is not considering her contributions to the home and marriage.  I am honestly just finding this post lacking in information  ( She is still very wrong to say the older kids should get nothing)\n",

If it’s a preference then she *can* support herself if she needs to after he’s gone. And if she’s getting his life insurance then he’s already made sure she won’t be left destitute.\n",

The take home for the family would only be 10k (less than ONE child to go to daycare for the year in my area) The overall benefit of me running the house is worth more than that, and our household is better off with me at home. and not for nothing I am busy with stuff till 6pm every day so, no not lazy there is always plenty to do. and my family has a stress free weekend together because I finished all the cooking, cleaning, scheduling during the week.\n",
      "He's described it weirdly. She receives nothing *of his* if he passes first, but their property isn't all his. He said that she gets his life insurance, and that their house and the joint bank account get divided between them. He doesn't leave her anything, but that's because he can't leave her share anywhere in the first place -- it isn't his to leave. It belongs to her from the start.\n",
      "She is getting half the house and half the wealth. He is taking his half of the money and dividing it up\n",

His job requires him to travel a fair amount, which means I am home by myself with the kids for at least one week out of each month (sometimes it’s two). Next week, a friend he hasn’t seen in several years who lives on the other side of the country from us will be about five hours from where we live. My husband has decided to take three days off work and drive down to see his friend. The morning after he returns from that visit with his friend, he is scheduled to leave for a week-long work trip.\\n \\nWhen he decided to drive down to see his friend, he suggested that the kids and I go as well. This seems like a terrible idea to me for a few reasons. First, our oldest is in school, so it would mean pulling her out for three days. Second, he and his friend have plans to play golf all day on two of the days. So I’d be by myself with the kids, in a town where the only real attraction (the beach) is going to be too chilly for the kids to play. (Also, if I’m being honest, I’m not wild about the idea of having three kids ages 6 and under at the beach all day without any help.) Third, his friend is traveling with his girlfriend, who is in her early 20s. I can’t imagine that they’re going to want to spend their vacation hanging out at kid-friendly establishments. \\n\\nI definitively told my husband that the kids and I are not coming, and he’s furious with me. I tried to make the above points to him and ask him why he thinks it’s a good idea for us to come, and he just keeps repeating that it would be fun. My suspicion is that he feels guilty about taking a “for fun” trip the week before he turns around and leaves on business for a week, so he’s trying to flip things around and make it sound like he tried to plan a getaway for us and I refused so he’s forced to go alone. \\n\\nMy friends have suggested that I’m being too cynical and that maybe he just really wants his friend to meet our kids. He hasn’t said anything like that, but to be honest even if that were his reason I’m not sure that justifies packing up the kids for a 5 hour car ride and hanging out in a hotel room (or finding something to do solo with a 6, 3, and 1 year old in a beach town in November) until they get done with golf and we can eat dinner for 2 hours before the baby has to go to bed. AITA here?\\n\\nUPDATE: This sub is like magic. I showed him this post and the responses and it shut him down immediately. He also added “I had already decided to send you to the spa for a day when I get back.” I’m 99% sure he had done nothing of the sort, but he will now! Thanks, team!\\n\\nLAST UPDATE: I obviously posted this in the hopes of being able to give my husband an “I told you so,” but I really am touched by some of the messages I’ve received offering support and resources related to emotional abuse. As I’ve said in my reply to some of those messages, I’m very lucky in that this is truly out of character for my husband—so out of character that I took to the internet to make sure I wasn’t missing something. In reality, we have a strong and mutually supportive relationship that allows me to stay home with my kids (which is totally my choice—my dream in fact. I’m an attorney, so I’d always have a way to support myself if things ended). If that weren’t the case, though, the messages I’ve been receiving would be incredibly helpful.
