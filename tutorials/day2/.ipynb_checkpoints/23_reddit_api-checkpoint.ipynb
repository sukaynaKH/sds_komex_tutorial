We'll cover different functionalities of the Reddit API, including fetching posts, comments, submitting new posts, voting, and more. Throughout the tutorial, we'll use a real-life example by collecting data from the subreddit r/worldnews."

       "'My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.\\nHis sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren\\'t close but get along fine.\\n\\nOlivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey\\'s privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I\\'ve already asked the girls to respect Zoey\\'s privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they\\'re girls and this\\'s typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. \\n\\nLast straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don\\'t know much about makeup but that\\'s what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.\\nI told my wife and she said she\\'d ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\\n\\nSammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren\\'t happy, the girls were extremely upset.\\nSammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren\\'t thieves!!! it\\'s normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn\\'t even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey\\'s personality trying to appear older than she is.\\nHe accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\\n\\nI told him this\\'s between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey\\'s door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\\n\\nShe got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family\\'ll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which\\'s something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn\\'t for her family\\'s unwillingness to help we wouldn\\'t be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\\n\\nEveryone\\'s been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.'"

      "My boss was the one on a soap box telling all of us the vaccines are shady and the virus is fake.  He was induced to coma and cant work anymore.  Was getting better and supposed to come back this week.  Apparently he has double pneumonia because his kid brought some “crud” home from school.  He is barely recognizable.  It sucked the life right out of him and he still denies covid is real.\n",

      "But what is supposed to happen next? Vaccine development is still ongoing, but the disease was so badly managed that there's no way to eradicate it. It's impossible. Until we have a universal vaccine ala the measles shot, it will be a problem for humanity in the foreseeable future.\n",
      "Caught COVID back at the end of July. Ever since I've had tinnitus in my right ear and things sound slightly higher pitched and almost robotic at times. An ENT shows no swelling, nothing blocking my ear canal... and just says, \"You'll get used to it. It gets better.\"\n",

I also already had lupus so it’s hard to know if the symptoms I  still experiencing (pain fatigue and brain fog) is from the lupus or from Covid.\n",
      "I feel bad for everyone who got all messed up from this stupid virus. Me and my girlfriend got it (I was vaccinated and she wasnt at the time) she was sick for like 3 weeks and I had a headache for about 3 days and that was it. I can't tell if I have any residual things from it but the more I think about it, my girlfriend might.\n",

      "I have Covid right now and it’s considered a mild case, yet I still would not wish this on anyone.  This illness is a force to be reckoned with.  I’m so glad I got vaccinated because I know it would have been so much worse.  Covid sucks something awful.  So many people from my place of work out as well and we only get paid for 5 days.  Well guess what has lasted longer than 5 days for majority of people?  Sigh.  Yeah, this is a problem I’d say.\n",

      "I managed to avoid covid until this summer; I didn’t have a runny nose or sore throat or anything like that. I had the most intense muscle pains I’ve ever had! My entire body for 24hrs was in agony, I was freezing but roasting and my head felt like it might explode. Maybe 30hrs total. 4 days later my taste went, along with my ability to smell. That was June and I can only just smell strong scents again and my tastebuds are weird as hell. People losing the ability to taste and smell seems like a health emergency to me.\n",

      "I understand it’s still deadly, still very real and everyone would be wise to take all reasonable precautions to avoid contracting Covid.  I just scheduled my multivariant booster and don’t deny the severity of the virus.  But, at what point does it stop being an emergency and start being something else?  It’s not really emerging any more, given issues with reporting testing and tracking cases it wouldn’t surprise me to learn that the majority of people have already had Covid in one form or another in the past three years.\n",
      "What's the long term plan though because wearing masks forever and not doing any of the fun activities of life but still go to work isn't it.\n",
      "Got Covid sometime in June/July and I've had weird issues with breathing through my nose ever since. Double vaccinated, Covid still sucked, and I'm still dealing with bs from it.\n",

      "COVID is very real. I was very sick for 2 weeks with covid some weeks ago, but I was also having a bad UTI where I had to take a bunch of medicine for that. My school actually kicked me out because of this, despite me giving documents of me having covid and UTI (went even to the hospital at some point cause they thought I had an kidney infection). It sucks ass.\n",
      "The WHO needs to look up the definition of \"emergency\".\n",

      "When an emergency can never end, it ceases to be an emergency.\n",
      "Yea but we're tired of hearing about it so we'll just ignore it, like climate change\n",

      "She was done after 1 week, i had it for almost 3 weeks, the first 5 days we're pretty okay, some coughing here, some sneezing there.\n",
      "\n",
      "10 days in and I started getting heavy headache's and shivering, after 2 weeks everything started smelling like burned plastic which stayed until week 3, after that i was done with COVID and felt pretty okay and started working again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shouldn't have done that, first week of work was fine, but at week 2 i started getting dizzy and headache's came back, fell into the deepest depression i had since 20 years, it was hell, and it's still not gone, literally depression out of nowhere, not thinking about anything negative, but just, my mind is blank, i can't concentrate on anything anymore and working more than 4hours makes me physically feel sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not wishing that on anybody, not even my worst enemies lol.\n",
      "Caught it for the first time last Thursday. Shit definitely isn’t the fucking flu like most of these denying assholes say it is. Fucking sucks ass!\n",
      "People who haven't gotten it yet need to know that the after effects can be WAY worse than the sickness itself. If you're vaccinated and not immunocompromised, the sickness will probably be like a mild flu, but even a mild case can result in brutal, long-lasting after effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "After nearly 3 years safe, I finally got it last week. It was very mild, and as it was wearing off, I thought I was gonna be fine. Then, a couple days ago, I made myself a salad with vinaigrette dressing, and it smelled absolutely vile - like a combination of ammonia, rubbing alcohol, and rotting fruit. It was such a bizarre smell that I knew it couldn't just be regular spoilage, so I looked it up, and sure enough, it's something called parosmia and it can last over a year after covid. While it started with vinegar, over the past few days, it has expanded to more smells, to the point that it's legitimately difficult to find things to eat. A lot of my favorite foods are just completely off-limits to me now.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - if you're not too worried about getting covid because most cases are mild, you should be more worried about it ruining your favorite foods for a year.\n",

      "The only unvaccinated guy at work who's been doesn't believe in any of this finally got covid and was basically on his death bed for a month. NOW he's taking it seriously like 3 years later, imagine where we'd be he people like him just listened in the beginning.\n",

      "Biden saying “The pandemic is over” on 60 Minutes was really stupid.\n",
      "I have 2 friends right now that are experiencing crazy hair loss post Covid. That in itself is enough for me to wear a mask.\n",
      "Don't care, got covid three times and kicked it, and I got the vaccine and the boosters. Not worried about it. Eventually we need to accept that we are living in a world in which covid exists and just move on with our lives.\n",
      "Pandemic fatigue has left me no longer caring what other people do. I will dutifully take my boosters and wear masks when it is preferred that they are worn, but that is as far as I will go.\n",
      "Never got COVID until I was already vaccinated and boosted. Was just a mild cold for a couple of days I was even able to work no problem (I work from home)\n",
      "\n",
      "People, vaccinate!\n",
      "Ofc it is. It never left. People are just shitty and more worried about having to stay home more than they are the health of anyone else so they just stopped talking about it and acted like it was gone.\n",
      "I got it this past Friday for the first time, I got better yesterday.. I got it from my 60 yo mom who has diabetes, she's also better now.. it was honestly more or less like the flu.\n",

      "Had it December 2021. Got through it pretty fine (was like having the flu). Two weeks later long covid symptoms started (about 16 different symptoms). Was double vaxxed at the time. Almost 9 months later and I’m almost back to “normal” though sometimes I feel like I don’t remember what that actually was. Worst time of my life.\n",
      "I got Covid in August of 2020 after a mountain hike. I was 18 at the time, had just gotten out of high school as a short/mid distance freestyler and a short/mid distance backstroker (swimming). I was in fantastic shape. Resting heart rate of 48, low BMI, great cardiovascular health from training 20 hours a week for months. 5:30-7am M, W, F before school. 3:30-6pm M-F after school. And 6-9am Saturdays. I was training to pay for college with scholarships for the sport. I was pretty damn good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Covid ruined that for me. I was sick for 2 weeks, had to go to the ER for treatment but I pulled through it. The long term effects have been terrible. I have IBS, I can’t do much cardio anymore, I have Bipolar II Disorder, and there are whole days where I’m just constantly dizzy when I’m standing. It is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. Instead of my dream college I’m going to one at home because I just have to. All of that work to pay for college with swimming is now null. I fucking hate Covid.\n",

      "I had Covid for the first time this past month. It sucked - high fever, excruciating headache, and horrendous bone pain. Took me 3 weeks to feel normal. Now, about 6 weeks out, I’m having kidney pain and signs of damage. Which is apparently a pretty common side effect. Keeping my mask on forever I guess.\n",

Currently isolating myself from my spouse, kids and m-i-l and on about day 4. I do NOT want them to get it, because I still don't know how their bodies will react, and my m-i-l especially since she is 68 and has breathing problems already.

I don't mean to come off as some anti-vaxxer though, I am vaccinated and COVID did suck for me, but I didn't have long term neurological issues or diabetes or cardiovascular issues or what have you, nor do I know a single person who does or has even been hospitalized, but does that mean anything?

While he was positive, he remained isolated with food and beverages brought to his door and left on the table outside the room. He masked when opening the door and shut the door as quickly as possible. After he broke his fever, he came into common areas masked *only when necessary*, washed his hands before and after touching anything, and Lysol’d everything he touched, even with clean hands. I masked in common areas and isolated in a different room. Common areas were only occupied by either of us *separately* while we had to utilize those spaces for mandatory requirements (food, bathroom, etc). He remained isolated for ten days, three of which he tested negative each day. I constantly washed my hands if I had to go into common areas, and the door was shut at all times to the room I isolated in as well.

      "This is factually correct!\n",
      "let me get dust the old 9/11 conversion table.\n",
      "Yeah, that and... masks might be quite bad at stopping the super contagious strains of covid but... for colds, flu and other airborne diseases they do wonders, which is why numbers are down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here in Japan, we had negative excess deaths in 2020 and 2021 even when adding up Covid deaths because so many people were saved from regular diseases. Most people are still masking 99% of the time and being mindful of distance and hygiene.\n",

      "Me too! What's our virtual gang bang password?\n",
      "Even if you take the lowest US 7-day average of the last 6 months, you get 260\\*365 ~= 95 000 deaths per year. That is around 1.8 times as many as died in the worst flu season in the last 10 years by deaths [(52 000, 2017-2018)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html). And for the last three months, the rate has been between 360 and 550. The middle of that range gives 455\\*365 ~= 166 000 deaths per year, over 3 times the worst recent influenza season referenced above. And it seems the rate might stay in this ballpark for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "For covid deaths I used [NYTimes data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).\n",
      "There was a very bad flu strain going around in late 2019 early 2020. So your doctor was most likely correct. COVID started spreading then too, but it wasn’t that widespread.\n",
      "Crazy how January of 2020 was the calm before the storm. I'd heard about Covid and even asked my girlfriend, a biologist, whether we should look at buying masks, but nobody thought it would get as bad as it did. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remember going to Vons at the end of January and an old woman was fully decked out in mask and gloves. After paying for her groceries, she yelled at all of us and the tellers that we should have been wearing gloves and masks, and initially we wrote her off as a crazy person since we didn't know much about the virus at the time. In hindsight, she was definitely ahead of the rest of us. Even if the gloves were unnecessary since Covid doesn't spread much through contact, she was still taking safety measures where the rest of us weren't.\n",

      "What an unbelievable event to live through, it's upsetting to think that many of us will likely live to see another pandemic, but I guess our modern lifestyle comes at a cost.\n",

      "So how many people has Biden killed by claiming covid is over? I seem to recall every digit of the death toll being personally attributed to trump while he was in office so can you get me a rough estimate on how many were slain by Biden’s dangerous misinformation?\n",

At some point, around a month after testing positive, I tried to drink a beer. I got half way, and felt like I was dying from alcohol poisoning.\n",
      "My colleague, who is probably like 25 at most, lost her new husband to long COVID. He was an EMT and got COVID before the vaccines were available and apparently suffered for a year or so with breathing problems, etc, until he finally passed away from complications one day. Dude was young and had his whole life ahead of him. COVID is no joke.\n",

      "Same here. I'm not scared of covid because I think I may die. I'm young, healthy and had 3 doses of the vaccine thus far. Death seems unlikely. But so many people have had serious after effects of the sickness even if they only had a mild case. I don't wanna be one of them.\n",
      "I'm getting fuckers who reply back to me that the shots were ineffective since I got long covid and taking that as justification that the shots dont do anything. No you fuckers, the shots are for the initial infection. Its because of fuckers like them that didnt treat this seriously that its still a fucking thing and im suffering from long covid.\n",

      "We know Covid causes damage in the vascular system, it attacks the lining of blood vessels which can in turn have an effect on almost every system in the body.  We know heart attack and stroke/clot risk go WAY up for a long time after a covid infection, across different age groups and risk factors.  We KNOW it can cause healthy people to develop diabetes. We know it can cause brain issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like, we KNOW all these things and just doing the math, that means even among people who survive or had mild infections, it's basically a mass disabling event.  China is playing the long game to keep it's labor force functional over the long term.  We're playing the short game to keep the economy moving now.  There's a lot of things I don't like about China, and I know that approach would never work here, but I honestly think there's good reason for what they're doing and it will pay off for them.\n",

      "\n",
      "It definitely diminishes my enjoyment of food and life in general, other people I know get all excited about cooking, restaurants etc. But to me it's just calories to stay alive. I'd as soon go to McDonald's, woof the burger in a minute and get on with my life as go for a fancy meal. \n",

      "My step kids are vaccinated, got their flu shot and take daily vitamins.  It isn't fool proof, but we have yet to get sick in the last 2 years. This year I feel will be different tho, masks are no where to be seen, its just a matter of time now.\n",
      "I wish somebody would have told me, having a young kid means your whole house is gonna get hella sick about once every 4-6 weeks.\n",
      "Yep, \"survivorship bias\" I believe it's called. Plane builders in WW2 were putting the armor on the wrong spots because damaged planes coming back from bombing runs had the most flak damage there. When in reality the planes that actually get shot down and don't survive to come back were shot in other parts of the plane.\n",
